# An-autonomous-attendance-system-based-on-machine-learning-concept
The attendance check is hugely crucial in the management of the classroom. The time-consuming way of taking attendance is by the following prior methods such as signing the name in a paper sheet or calling the names of each student. In particular, it is vulnerable to cheating and other fraudulent activity. Artificial Intelligence based applications benefit from face recognition, which is a valuable piece of work. The suggested system aims to develop a comprehensive face recognition system capable of dealing with many photos. The central technological concept of this system is Machine Learning to detect human faces and identify a person. Haar-Cascade is a face detection algorithm that identifies the face from a sequence of photos used for training and testing. The dataset uses negative and positive images to train the algorithm called Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) and the same data has been used to check the system. The LBPH algorithm is responsible for recognizing faces in input images. Python Tkinter is very effective in making desktop GUI software, So the core element of the developed system is Tkinter. The database of the system is MySQL. With the capability of this technology trialed in a class, the outcome result is highly positive — a survey completed among students to inspect the students’ opinion and find out the advantages and disadvantages.

The attendance system project has seven Python source files,
• main.py for the homepage
• student.py for student details page
• train.py for training the algorithm
• face_recognition.py for recognizing face
• attendance.py for marking attendance
• help.py for asking help
• developer.py contains developer information
